### **🔮 Suspense Mode (Hidden Elimination)**
1. Click the 💀 (skull icon) in the top right corner.
2. A **text input box** appears where a player can type in a name.
   - ⚠️ The text color matches the background, making the entry hidden!
3. The fingerprint icon will turn green when the typed text successfully matches a player's name **(OK to proceed)**.
3. Press **Enter** to start a **5-second countdown** before elimination.  
4. After the countdown, the selected player is eliminated!
